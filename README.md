# Magnetic-Hide-and-Go-Seek

This project featured a hide and go seek game between a robotic arm and a magnetic sensor. The magnetic sensor would communicate how close
the arm, with a magnet attached to it, was to the sensor. Using this information the robotic arm surveyed areas that had higher readings
to find the location with the highest value. Once this location was found, the arm ended the program.

Use Case: The same algorithm will be implemented to find “IED’s and mines” that will be represented by magnets. This could also be
implemented for any searching purpose using a sensor.
